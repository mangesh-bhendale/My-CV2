<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a theoretical chemist and computational material scientist with expertise in <u>machine learning</u>, <u>electronic structure</u>, <u>statistical mechanics</u> and <u>scientific programming</u>. I am interested in predicting the <u>phase-behaviour of bulk and confined systems</u> using machine-learning and first-principles methods. Traditionally, these approaches require very high computational effort or are computationally prohibitive for many systems. My work therefore encompasses <u>development</u> of <u>predictive</u> yet <u>computationally affordable techniques</u> for <u>crystal strcuture prediction</u>, <u>quantum vibrational spectra</u>, and <u>phase-diagram calculation</u>. I am currently applying these techniques to compute <u>phase-diagrams of nanoconfined water</u> in close collaboration with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/person/am452"> Angelos Michaelides </a> and <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/"> The Ice Group </a>.
