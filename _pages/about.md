I am a theoretical chemist / computational material scientist. I work on understanding the phase-behaviour of bulk and confined systems by means of machine-learning and first-principles approaches. Traditionally, these approaches require very high computational effort or are computationally prohibitive for many systems. My work therefore encompasses developement of predictive yet computationally affordable techniques for crystal strcuture prediction, quantum vibrational spectra, and phase-diagram calculation. To this extent, I combine machine learning, high-level electronic structure theory and quantum statistical mechanics. I am currently applying these techniques to compute phase-diagrams of nanoconfined water in close collaboration with [Angelos Michaelides](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/person/am452) and [The Ice Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/michaelides/).


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
